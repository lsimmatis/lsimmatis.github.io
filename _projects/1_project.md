This project is focused on designing a new technology for analyzing speech in people with neurological impairments. The first question you might ask is, well, why do we care about speech in neurological diseases? Because speech is such a tightly controlled sensorimotor process, it can provide a very valuable window into the function of large tracts of the central nervous system at once. 

The audio signal produced by speech, far from being a simple waveform, actually consists of multiple interacting components that reflect a variety of contributions of the sensorimotor system, includig the respiratory system, the laryngeal and velopharyngeal apparatuses, and the oral articulators. The rhythmicity, force generation, and timing of each/all of these systems reflect motor control processes, either in health or, of interest for this project, in neurological diseases. With the preceding description, it is quite clear how diseases that affect the sensorimotor system (such as Parkinson's disease, Lou Gehrig's disease/ALS, multiple sclerosis, etc.) can all affect speech output in unique ways.

The central problem with present technical gold standards of speech assessment is that they can be cumbersome, and so they have to stay in the lab. However, this makes it quite difficult to implement them in practice - patients essentially need to be part of research studies to even use them, to say nothing of how this precludes their use in clinical practice. Home-based systems have been available for a few years now, but they all have their own limitations, such as poor data quality or limited ability to test diverse speech tasks.

Our project seeks to overcome these hurdles, by implementing (1) multimodal audio/video data collection, and (2) robust, high-quality data collection methodologies.
