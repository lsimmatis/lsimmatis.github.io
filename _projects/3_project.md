This project is focused on using ASR techniques for improved acoustic feature extraction from real world data (RWD) for the purpose of neurological disease (e.g., ALS) detection. Speech science has enabled a detailed understanding of speech production, and ways that it can be affected by various disease states. One of the core challenges of classical speech assessment methods is that they are time-consuming and cumbersome, which has prevented clinical adoption. However, many valuable clinically-interpretable correlates of disease state can be identified in the speech signal. Several of these are difficult to extract reliably, and so cannot be leveraged easily. This project proposes to facilitate the automated extraction of these desirable acoustic features to improve detection of neurological diseases, by using state-of-the-art ASR methods. Our objective will be to characterize the performance of phoneme-level ASR systems' performance, and improve it using transfer learning to more effective use in patients with severe dysarthria.
