I work as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto in the [Speech Production Lab](https://slp.utoronto.ca/faculty/yana-yunusova/speech-production-lab/) under supervision of Dr. Yana Yunusova, and am also an intern at Winterlight Labs as part of a Mitacs Elevate fellowship. My current research focuses on the development of digital speech biomarkers in neurological diseases like ALS, stroke, and Parkinson's Disease. I have a PhD from Queen's University, where I studied under Dr. Stephen Scott in the [Laboratory of Integrative Motor Behaviour](https://www.queensu.ca/limb/), and the focus of my research was using robotic upper-limb assessments to detect neurological diseases. 

I really love digital health and the use of technology in health sciences, and have lots of fun learning about and using new methods to give insight into disease. Feel free to get in touch on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leif-simmatis) to discuss, or email me at firstname.lastname@uhn.ca.
