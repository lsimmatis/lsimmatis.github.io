I work as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto in the [Speech Production Lab](https://slp.utoronto.ca/faculty/yana-yunusova/speech-production-lab/) under supervision of Dr. Yana Yunusova, and an intern at Winterlight Labs as part of a Mitacs Elevate fellowship. My current research focuses on the development of digital speech biomarkers in neurological diseases like ALS, stroke, and Parkinson's Disease. I have a PhD from Queen's University, where I studied under Dr. Stephen Scott in the [Laboratory of Integrative Motor Behaviour](https://www.queensu.ca/limb/), and the focus of my research was using robotic upper-limb assessments to detect neurological diseases. 

Additionally, I am the acting Head of Neurosciences at [Cove Neuro](https://coveneuro.com), which is a brain biomarker company that is focused on using EEG to measure and detect diseases, which supports hardware and pharmaceutical development processes. 

I really love digital health and finding uses for new technologies in health sciences, and have lots of fun solving problems that may help human health. Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leif-simmatis), or via email at (firstname).(lastname)@uhn.ca.
